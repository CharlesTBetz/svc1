  Brief Synopsis
  
Project summary - This Project is purely based on Google Cloud Solutions with Configuring Docker Image and containerizing it on GCP.
  
 Steps:

 2. Modified the 'hello world' application.
 3. Packeged and ran the application on Docker using docker image.
 4. Pushed it back to the team's github repostiory (SVC3).
 5. Cloned the SVC3 repostory to GCP.
 6. Ran the docker image on GCP

Challenges - Figuring out how to run docker on GCP and pushing it to Docker took plenty of time. However it was a good learning curve for us to self explore the new teechnologies.

Current status - We have successfully built the docker image on GCP and pushed it Docker hub for deployment team to run on Kubernetes.
