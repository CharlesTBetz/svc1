Systems Description 
  Brief Synopsis
  
Project summary - This Project is purely based on Google Cloud Solutions with Configuring Docker Image and containerizing it on GCP.
  
 Steps:
 1. We forked the files from Githb repository
 2. Modified the 'hello world' application.
 3. Packeged and ran the application on Docker using docker image.
 4. Pushed it back to the team's github repostiory (SVC3).
 5. Cloned the SVC3 repostory to GCP.
 6. Ran the docker image on GCP
 7. Containerized and pushed it to Docker Hub (Container registry)
 8. The kubernetes Deployment team took the control from here.
 
 Coding instructions:
 
 Open the GCP console
 pwd
 ls
 git init
 git clone https://github.com/dm-academy/svc3.git
 make your directory - mkdir Service3
 cp svc3 Service3/ -rwx
 ls -la
 cd svc3
 cat package.json
 nano package.json
 node package.json
 npm install
 node server.js
 nano Dockerfile
 docker build -t your account/node-web-app .
 nano run.sh
  ./run.sh
 nano pub.sh
 # Inside pub.sh - to push docker image to container registry
     docker tag [SOURCE_IMAGE] [HOSTNAME]/[PROJECT-ID]/[IMAGE]:[TAG]
     examples: docker tag your server name/node-web-app gcr.io/rational-autumn-234222/dockersvc3
     gcloud docker  -- push  gcr.io/rational-autumn-234222/dockersvc3:latest
 gcloud auth configure-docker
 sudo ./pub.sh
 git add pub.sh
 git commit -m 'docker pushed'
 git config --global user.email tanyagarhwal.07@gmail.com
 git config --global user.name your github name
 git config --global user.email  email ID
 git commit -m 'docker pushed'
 git log
 ls
 git push -f origin master
 exit

Challenges - Figuring out how to run docker on GCP and pushing it to Docker Hub took plenty of time. However it was a good learning curve for us to self explore the new teechnologies.

Current status - We have successfully built the docker image on GCP and pushed it Docker hub for deployment team to run on Kubernetes.
